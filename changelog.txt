0.1 
Created general code structure.
Made update and render in separate threads.
A basic state system.
How the structure works:
	1)Main.class starts the Game.class.
	2)Game.class starts threads in ThreadManager.class
	3)ThreadManager starts a game state specified in Game.class
	3)PlayState creates a World
